This section contains the essential data files required for model application, as well as intermediary outputs generated during the operational processes. These resources facilitate user-driven prediction analysis and result interpretation. Detailed descriptions are as follows:

1. Application Layer Data
The following data files are provided to support the model application layer:

CHP_Encoder: Encodes Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) components to support model input processing.
CHP_Medicinal_properties: Contains medicinal property data for TCM, which informs model-based analysis and prediction.
Test_input: This file serves as the test input dataset. Users may modify this data to suit their own prediction and analysis needs.
Note: Training data files are not currently provided. The following files are therefore not included:

all_hypergraphs_with_labels-train.pkl
all_graphs_with_labels-train.pt
2. Operational Layer Data
Intermediary files generated during the model's operation document the output and relevant attention mechanisms, assisting users in analyzing and interpreting prediction processes:

prediction_outputs: Logs the modelâ€™s prediction outputs for further analysis.
attention_weights: Contains the distribution of attention weights, allowing insights into which features are emphasized by the model.
attention_averages: Records averaged attention weights, simplifying feature analysis.
calculated_attention_weights: Contains processed attention weight data to quantify the interactions and relationships among medicinal herbs within a prescription.
3. Additional Data Resources
