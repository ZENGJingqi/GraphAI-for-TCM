The Model folder houses a single, but essential, file for the implementation of graph-based machine learning in the context of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compatibility analysis:

gat_model.pth: This file contains the pretrained weights for a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, a sophisticated neural network architecture designed specifically to handle graph-structured data. The GAT model leverages attention mechanisms to dynamically assign weights to neighboring nodes in a graph, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant relationships for a given task. By adjusting these weights, the GAT model identifies key interactions and dependencies among nodes, which is particularly beneficial for domains like TCM, where the relationships between components (such as medicinal herbs) are complex and multi-faceted.

The gat_model.pth file serves as the core of the analytical capability in this repository, offering a pretrained model that can be directly applied to prediction tasks or further fine-tuned to suit specific research objectives. This model is designed to interpret and quantify the intricate compatibility mechanisms within TCM, such as synergistic effects and contraindications among medicinal components. It supports both node and edge attribute integration, which allows it to capture and analyze the nuanced, multi-dimensional relationships present in TCM data.
